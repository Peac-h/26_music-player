# Project 26 - Music App (OOP Project)

This is a JavaScript Music App built in the object-oriented programming paradigm using JS ES6 Classes and modules.

The music can be played, paused, and tracks can be switched to next or previous. The app also has shuffle and repeat states. Additionally, users can manually update the song time by tapping on the progress line.

The controls are hidden and only revealed when hovering over the player. However, for non-hover devices, the controls are displayed immediately.

The app contains ten beautiful tracks and is responsive to all screen sizes.

**This is my 26th small project so far.**
